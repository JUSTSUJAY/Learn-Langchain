    "# Key Features of LangChain\n",
    "\n",
    "A key feature of LangChain is its support for prompts, which includes prompt management, prompt optimization, and a unified interface for all LLMs (Large Language Models). The framework also offers common utilities for working with LLMs.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Structured Conversations with ChatPromptTemplate\n",
    "\n",
    "The `ChatPromptTemplate` is designed for creating structured conversations with AI models. This approach simplifies the management of conversation flow and content. LangChain uses message prompt templates to construct and work with prompts, enabling us to harness the full potential of underlying chat models.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Role of System and Human Prompts\n",
    "\n",
    "System and Human prompts play distinct roles and serve different purposes when interacting with chat models:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `SystemMessagePromptTemplate`: These prompts provide initial instructions, context, or data to the AI model. They set the stage for the conversation.\n",
    "- `HumanMessagePromptTemplate`: These prompts represent messages from the user that the AI model responds to. They drive the interactive nature of the conversation.\n",
    "\n",
    "LangChain's prompt templates empower users to engage effectively with AI models through well-structured conversations.\n"
