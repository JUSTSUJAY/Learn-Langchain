    "# Introduction\n",
    "You have two main options: hosting models on your servers or using OpenAI's API. Local hosting gives you control but has hardware and maintenance costs. Some models are not for commercial use. The right choice depends on budget, expertise, and data sensitivity. Models vary in size and capabilities. GPT-3 Ada is small and fast, best for simple tasks. GPT-4 is large, slow, and versatile. \n",
