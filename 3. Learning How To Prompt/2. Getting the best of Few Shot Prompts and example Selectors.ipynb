    "explore how `few-shot prompts` and `example selectors` can enhance the performance of language models in LangChain. Implementing Few-shot prompting and Example selection in LangChain can be achieved through various methods. We'll discuss three distinct approaches\n",
    "\n",
    "## Alternating Human/AI messages\n",
    "In this strategy, few-shot prompting utilizes alternating human and AI messages. This technique can be especially beneficial for chat-oriented applications since the language model must comprehend the conversational context and provide appropriate responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "While this approach effectively handles conversation context and is easy to implement for chat-based applications, it lacks flexibility for other application types and is limited to chat-based models. However, we can use alternating human/AI messages to create a chat prompt that translates English into pirate language. The code snippet below demonstrates this approach."
